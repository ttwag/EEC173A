Q14: Host A and B are directly connected with a 100Mbps link. There is one TCP connection between the two hosts, and Host A is sending to Host B an enormous file over this connection. Host A can send its application data into its TCP socket at a rate as high as 120 Mbps, but Host B can read out of its TCP receive buffer at a maximum rate of 50Mbps. Consider the effect of TCP flow control.

**What is the effective sending rate of A to B initially?**

The effective sending rate is capped at 50Mbps

**What is the approximate rate at which the receiver buffer fills up**

Approximately 50Mbps

**What happens when the receiver buffer is full?**

The receiver sends a window size of 0 to the sender.

**What is the overall effect of TCP flow control on the sender, Host A?**

TCP flow control sets A's sending rate to 50Mbps.

Flow control ensures A's packet aren't loss from buffer overflow.
