Suppose N packets arrive simultaneously at a link at which no packets are currently being transmitted or queued. Each packet is of length L and the link has transmission rate R. What is the average queuing delay for the N packets? Simplify your answer. 


We know that the queuing delay for the first packet is 0.

For the second packet, it's $\frac{L}{R}$ because of the first packet.

For the third packet, it's $2 * \frac{L}{R}$ because of the first and second packet.

For the fourth packet, it's $3 * \frac{L}{R}$ because of the first, second, and third packet.

In  general, the kth packet has $(k - 1) (\frac{L}{R})$ delay, so the total delay of N packets is 

$$T_{total} = \sum_{k = 1}^{N} (k - 1)\frac{L}{R}$$

, and the average delay of the N packet is 

$$T_{avg} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k = 1}^{N} (k - 1)\frac{L}{R}$$

$$\implies \frac{L}{NR} \sum_{k = 1}^{N} (k - 1)$$

$$\implies \frac{L}{NR}(\sum_{k = 1}^{N}k - \sum_{k = 1}^{N}1)$$

$$\implies \frac{L}{NR}(\sum_{k = 1}^{N}k - N)$$

$$\implies \frac{L}{NR}(\frac{N(N + 1)}{2} - N)$$

$$\implies \frac{L}{R}(\frac{(N + 1)}{2} - 1)$$

$$\implies \frac{L}{2R}(N - 1)$$

$$T_{avg} = \frac{L}{2R}(N - 1)$$
