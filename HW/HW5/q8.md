# Q8

Browser Caching. Consider an HTTP server and client as shown in the figure below. Suppose that the RTT delay between the client and server is 20 msecs; the time a server needs to transmit an object into its outgoing link is 0.75 msecs; and any other HTTP message not containing an object has a negligible (zero) transmission time. Suppose the client makes 40 requests, one after the other, waiting for a reply to a request before sending the next request.

Assume the client is using HTTP 1.1 (persistent HTTP) and the IF-MODIFIED-SINCE header line. Assume 60% of the objects requested have NOT changed since the client downloaded them (before these 40 download requests are performed). 

**How much time elapses (in milliseconds) between the client transmitting the first request, and the completion of the last request (ignoring TCP connection setup time)?**

RTT Delay = 20 ms

Transmission Delay = 0.75 ms

Clients made 40 HTTP Requests for objects

60% of objects have not changed

Total Delay = (0.4)(40)(0.75 + 20) + (0.6)(40)(20) = 812 ms
