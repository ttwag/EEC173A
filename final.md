[500*8 / (2*10^6)] + [(5000*10^3)/(2.5*10^8)] + [(500*10^3)/(10*10^6)] + [(4000*10^3)/(2.5*10^8)]+ [(500*10^3)/(1*10^6)] + [(1000*10^3)/(2.5*10^8)] = 0.0524 s

0.0884?

# Q8

Time = (0.8 * 40)(20 ms) + (0.2 * 40)(20 + 0.75 ms) = 806 ms

# Q9
Cost Reduction

If an institution employs a web cache, it could reduce the traffic from the institution to the internet. As a result, the institution won't have to upgrade the bandwidth thus the cost of the institution's internet service is reduced.

# 10

Minimum Time = 200

The bottleneck: The server upload rate, $\frac{NF}{u_s}$


# 11

Minimum Time = 133

The bottleneck: Specific client download rate,$\frac{F}{d_{min}}$.

# Q12



# Q13



# Q14

They should use sum and min for the path cost function and set the link weights as the number of hops. Inverse of bandwidth

# Q15

They should use max and sum for the path cost function and set the weights as the sum of available bandwidth.

# Q16

Change the F-I from 5 to 11

# Q17

$P_C(A, E) = (1 - 0.01) * (1 - 0.05) = 0.9405$

# Q18

$P_D(A, E) = (1 - 0.03) * (1 - 0.02) = 0.9506$

# Q19

A -> D -> E

# Q20

D = 10100111
G = 1001
r = 3

D * 2^r = 10100111000

$R = remainder\{\frac{D * 2^r}{G} \} = 001$

Codeword = 10100111001
